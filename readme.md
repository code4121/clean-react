# **4Devs - Polls for Programmers**

> ## Goal

This repo aims to build a ReactJS system avoiding the CRA boilerplate and configuring Webpack instead. Using hooks, a decoupled architecture, TDD as a work methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute all responsibilities in layers, following SOLID, DRY, YAGNI and KISS principles, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.

> ## Principles

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Open Closed Principle (OCP)
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
* Separation of Concerns (SOC)
